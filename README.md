## Matt & Erin's Wedding

A 1 day, 3-person group Phase 2 DBC project. Teammate Matt had just gotten married, and wanted a simple page to display all of the images from his wedding. He wanted family and friends to be allowed to login and post pictures that they took at the wedding. He also wanted users to be able to share the images to their Facebook.

# My role

I was responsible for integrating the Facebook API, which would allow users to share photos from the page onto their own Facebook newsfeed.
I also helped create user registration and login/logout functionality.
